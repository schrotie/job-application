	Dear Reader
</p>
<p>
	This is a demo version of the job application app. I removed
	some information in order to avoid spamming. If you need this
	information, you'll have received it from me, please stick to
	that version.
</p>
<p>
	Otherwise you may be interested in using this for your own job
	applications. Cool! Go ahead, feel free to swap out all the
	content and change it however you like.
</p>
<p>
	If you mention me, the original author of this, in the source
	of your job application I'll feel deeply honored and my belief
	in the good in man will be boosted. Maybe not my belief in the
	cunning of man, though: we all have to face real life, and
	maintaining a mention of me in your job application is not exactly
	ideal. Therefor this application is non-copyrighted, i.e. public
	domain under the <a href="http://unlicense.org/">Unlicense</a>.
	So screw me and get that job/project :-)
</p>
<p>
	Still, I'd obviously love to get improvements back into the source
	of this application. So pretty please, if you improve upon it,
	share it back. My personal tentative plans involve some helper
	tools for quickly generating project applications, or even a UI for
	customizing the whole thing. But whatever you got, please fork it
	and drop me a pull request on
	<a href="https://github.com/schrotie/job-application">GitHub</a>.
