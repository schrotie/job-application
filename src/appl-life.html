				<span>
					Little me, aged five, wanted to be a wildlife cameraman.
					In spite of my apparent stubbornness I slightly corrected
					that career aspiration to behavioral biologist a few years
					later.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div>
				<label>1992 ...</label>
				<span>
					When I finally grew up to that goal I found that the great
					names of that field had grown, too, i.e. tired of waiting for
					me; and died - and left their field somewhat deserted. What
					ultimately drove me was a keen desire to understand what makes
					us act the way we do. And finding no fulfillment in sticking
					electrodes into life stock brains I chose a then somewhat
					obscure path in that endeavor: simulating behavioral models.
					Which taught me programming
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">C and C++</span>
					besides other things.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div>
				<label>1999 ...</label>
				<span>
					Many lines of code and a couple of books later I
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">taught C++</span>
					to other biologists. I discovered my enthusiasm for
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">agile methodologies</span>,
					then in its incarnation of Extreme Programming.
					However, I had to escape the lone ranger mentality of academia
					first, and then the waterfall world of traditional software
					development before I could start living by that ideal. Instead
					I did lots of coding on my own, learning to
					<span class="emphasis join" on-tap="_context">administer Linux</span>
					as desktop, server and <span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">cluster</span>,
					honed my skills of <span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">presenting</span>
					complex subject matters, deep
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">analytical thinking</span> and
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">tutoring</span>. On the
					academic branch I researched
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">neural networks</span>.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="empty">
				<label>2006</label>
				<span>
					I never really wanted to make home in ivory tower. Having
					satisfied my hunger for that particular kind of knowledge as
					thoroughly as the field afforded at that time I decided to
					move on.
				</span>

			<div>

					Echelon, my first employer in business, called their chips
					"Neurons". I doubt they did it to attract biologists, but they
					got me anyway. I was lucky to work for a progressive boss
					who did <span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">AJAX</span>
					before it got that name. My occupation introduced me to all the
					long since forgotten buzzwords of the day -
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">JavaScript</span>,
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">XML</span>
					and all its derivatives in
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">web technology</span>,
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">service oriented
					architecture</span>
					and all that is dear to it. I learned a lot about making pieces
					of software talk via
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">HTTP</span>,
					<span class="emphasis join" on-tap="_context">designing</span>
					their
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">language</span> and
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">communication patterns</span>
					- to the point where I became a
					<span class="emphasis join" on-tap="_context">member of</span>
					some
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">OASIS technical
					committee</span> - building
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">user interfaces</span>,
					ample
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">jQuery</span>, and
					<span class="emphasis join" on-tap="_context">managed</span>
					my first
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">projects</span>.
				</span>

				<label>2013 ...</label>

					<div>
					Echelon closed many offices around the world, mine among those.
					My boss, five core developers, and I decided to build a new
					company, Arigo, upon what we had learned. I created what would
					become the kernel of Arigo's software from scratch, developing
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">full stack</span>. I
					initiated, chaired, and guided the creation of Arigo's
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">test driven</span>
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">agile development</span>
					process and trained our developers in the new technologies we
					were to
					employ: <span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">Nodejs</span>,
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">JSON</span>,
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">REST</span>,
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">web-sockets</span>,
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">mocha</span>,
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">selenium</span> - the
					stack of the modern web.
					</div>
					<div>
					Much of Arigo's success relies on bringing that stack down into
					the embedded hardware world. Our business niche was mostly in the
					middle layer between specific embedded devices and their
					plethora of obscure protocols on the one hand and the cloud on
					the other. We build web application from our platform mostly
					for Raspberry Pi league devices but some of our trustiest
					customers run enterprise systems in the cloud where we connect
					the embedded world to
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">SQL</span>
					data bases of a couple of dozen gigabytes and do
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">load balancing</span>
					for handling concurrent data queries.
					</div>
					<div>
					The first version of Arigo's UI framework was built upon
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">jQuery</span>.
					I did some work on
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">server side UI</span>
					using Node.js'
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">Express</span>,
					and some of its template engines but found that approach
					inappropriate for Arigo's needs, which are much better covered
					by <span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">client side UI</span>.
					For the evaluation of the next version I experimented with
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">Angular</span>,
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">Angular 2</span>, and
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">TypeScript</span>,
					but ultimately decided to use
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">web components</span>,
					powered by Google's
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">Polymer</span> and
					implemented in
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">object orientated JavaScript</span>,
					i.e.
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">EcmaScript 6/2015</span>.
					This was a huge relief after I had used my own object orientated
					JavaScript idiom at Echelon and jQuery UI's class system at
					Arigo - both are terribly clumsy compared to the built in
					elegance of EcmaScript 2015.
					</div>
					<div>
					As Arigo's CTO I managed the ongoing development, the people and
					the broad software architecture, worked with customers to
					understand their needs, discuss with our developers to figure
					out how to translate these needs into technology, estimate costs
					and keep one eye on the business side of our technology, the
					other on the future of our platform.
					</div>
					<div>
					My management style is decidedly non authoritarian. I work
					with grown up professionals and management is a service
					profession that facilitates developers getting their job done.
					My self perception is that of a mountain guide rather than a
					general, and I firmly believe this is the only way it can work
					with a distributed work force. People need to be aware
					of the consequences of their actions, but an iron fist a couple
					of hundred kilometers away would only weigh down him who raises
					it.
					</div>
					<div>
					Doubling as Arigo's single UI developer which took some 80% of
					my time, taught me to be very efficient in my communication. The
					specific combination of personalities in our company forced me
					to become a deescalation specialist or face the number one
					nemesis of start-ups: failure of communication. The former it
					was.
					</div>
			</div>
			<div class="empty">
				<label>2017</label>
				<span>
					Arigo is now a profitable endeavor with faithful customers.
					The really interesting stuff in IoT happens in scalable cloud
					deployments, not on the Pi - or rather the Pi-device-class may
					be the magic wand, but the magician enacts his tricks from high
					up in the cloud. So I moved to the cloud myself ...
				</span>
			</div>
			<div>
				<label>2017 - ?</label>
				<span>
					<div>
					... working remotely for QiO, an utterly distributed company,
					developing <span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">enterprise
					grade scalable cloud IoT solutions</span> for big business
					customers. I hit the ground running, meeting the customer on my
					first day after induction training and started planning the
					project with my new distributed team.
					</div>
					<div>
					We employed
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">Docker</span>,
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">Kubernetes</span>, and
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">Mongo DB</span>,
					utilizing
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">GitLab</span>,
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">Artifactory</span> and
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">Jenkins</span> to
					power our
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">continuous integration
					pipeline</span>. Over a couple of months of
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">test driven</span>
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">Scrum</span>
					development we delivered a system that is now entering
					production with the next major version being planned by me and a
					new team as of now. While developing the UI mostly by myself,
					again using Google's Polymer
					<span class="emphasis" on-tap="_context">web-component</span>
					framework, I laid the foundations for a themable, localizable
					UI framework to be reused in productization of the project.
