# Job Application

This is a self contained Polymer web app I use for job-/project-applications.
It runs from a single responsive HTML file from disk/mail-attachment/server.
It scales from phones to desktop and has an (A4!) print function, should
your HR contact want to waste dead trees on you.

If you want to use it, you'll have to base64-encode all the graphics you need,
swap out all the content with your stuff install bower and polymer-bundler
and finally call the build.sh (Linux shell script).

For development you'll have more fun if you install polymer-cli and run
`polymer serve`.

Enjoy.
