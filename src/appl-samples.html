			<h1>This Application</h1>
			<p>
				This web application was written by Thorsten Roggendorf from
				scratch. It was build from web components making use of the Polymer
				web components framework and some of its components.
				The application was then bundled into a self-contained HTML file
				that can be loaded directly into a compatible web browser without
				requiring a web server. It is designed to be fully responsive
				from smart phone to big screens to traditional print / PDF.
			</p>
			<p>
				It does work from a web server without problems, though, as
				demonstrated <a href="http://schrotie.de/applApp/demo.html">here</a>.<br/>
				The app's source code can be reviewed
				<a href="https://github.com/schrotie/job-application">here</a>.

			<h1>Hotel</h1>
			<p>
				This set of applications was developed for a hotel where staff
				and guests use it to control lights and climate in the rooms.
				It runs on wall mounted tablets and guest smart phones. The
				navigation menu in the top left is not part of the production
				app. It was developed for demonstration purpose. In production
				the different apps run on different addresses / devices.
				A hallmark of this app are the realistic lighting effects in the
				guest rooms. Not everything works in this demo, since it relies
				on data routed through the specific automation network of the
				hotel. Also it was developed for one specific browser, which runs
				on the tablets.<br/>
				Everything is built from web-components, all developed by Thorsten
				Roggendorf. For performance reasons no Polymer components were
				used.<br/>
				Please note that Arigo's UI was a one man show at that point. Upon
				my many responsibilities being a designer was one I do not particularly
				pride myself on. All artwork and image processing, layout, color
				choices ... please bear with me.<br/>
