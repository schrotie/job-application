	<span>
		Little me, aged five, wanted to be a wildlife cameraman.
		In spite of my apparent stubbornness I slightly corrected
		that career aspiration to behavioral biologist a few years
		later.

		<h4>Student</h4>
		When I finally grew up to that goal I found that the great
		names of that field had grown, too, i.e. tired of waiting for
		me; and died - and left their field somewhat deserted. What
		ultimately drove me was a keen desire to understand what makes
		us act the way we do. And finding no fulfillment in sticking
		electrodes into life stock brains I chose a then somewhat
		obscure path in that endeavor: simulating behavioral models.
		Which taught me programming
		<span class="emphasis">C and C++</span>
		besides other things.

		<h4>Scientific assistant at Bielefeld University</h4>
		Many lines of code and a couple of books later I
		<span class="emphasis">taught C++</span>
		to other biologists. I discovered my enthusiasm for
		<span class="emphasis">agile methodologies</span>,
		then in its incarnation of Extreme Programming.
		However, I had to escape the lone ranger mentality of academia
		first, and then the waterfall world of traditional software
		development before I could start living by that ideal. Instead
		I did lots of coding on my own, learning to
		<span class="emphasis join">administer Linux</span>
		as desktop, server and <span class="emphasis">cluster</span>,
		honed my skills of <span class="emphasis">presenting</span>
		complex subject matters, deep
		<span class="emphasis">analytical thinking</span> and
		<span class="emphasis">tutoring</span>. On the
		academic branch I researched
		<span class="emphasis">neural networks</span>.

		<h4>Web-Developer at Echelon EDC</h4>
		Echelon, my first employer in business, called their chips
		"Neurons". I doubt they did it to attract biologists, but they
		got me anyway. I was lucky to work for a progressive boss
		who did <span class="emphasis">AJAX</span>
		before it got that name. My occupation introduced me to all the
		long since forgotten buzzwords of the day -
		<span class="emphasis">JavaScript</span>,
		<span class="emphasis">XML</span>
		and all its derivatives in
		<span class="emphasis">web technology</span>,
		<span class="emphasis">service oriented
		architecture</span>
		and all that is dear to it. I learned a lot about making pieces
		of software talk via
		<span class="emphasis">HTTP</span>,
		<span class="emphasis join">designing</span>
		their
		<span class="emphasis">language</span> and
		<span class="emphasis">communication patterns</span>
		- to the point where I became a
		<span class="emphasis join">member of</span>
		some
		<span class="emphasis">OASIS technical
		committee</span> - building
		<span class="emphasis">user interfaces</span>,
		ample
		<span class="emphasis">jQuery</span>, and
		<span class="emphasis join">managed</span>
		my first
		<span class="emphasis">projects</span>.
	</span>
</div>
<div>
	<label>2013 ...</label>
	<span>
		<h4>CTO, co-founder and partner at ARIGO Software</h4>
		<div>
		Echelon closed many offices around the world, mine among those.
		My boss, five core developers, and I decided to build a new
		company, Arigo, upon what we had learned. I created what would
		become the kernel of Arigo's software from scratch, developing
		<span class="emphasis">full stack</span>. I
		initiated, chaired, and guided the creation of Arigo's
		<span class="emphasis">test driven</span>
		<span class="emphasis">agile development</span>
		process and trained our developers in the new technologies we
		were to
		employ: <span class="emphasis">Nodejs</span>,
		<span class="emphasis">JSON</span>,
		<span class="emphasis">REST</span>,
		<span class="emphasis">web-sockets</span>,
		<span class="emphasis">mocha</span>,
		<span class="emphasis">selenium</span> - the
		stack of the modern web.
		</div>
		<div>
		Much of Arigo's success relies on bringing that stack down into
		the embedded hardware world. Our business niche was mostly in the
		middle layer between specific embedded devices and their
		plethora of obscure protocols on the one hand and the cloud on
		the other. We build web application from our platform mostly
		for Raspberry Pi league devices but some of our trustiest
		customers run enterprise systems in the cloud where we connect
		the embedded world to
		<span class="emphasis">SQL</span>
		data bases of a couple of dozen gigabytes and do
		<span class="emphasis">load balancing</span>
		for handling concurrent data queries.
		</div>
		<div>
		The first version of Arigo's UI framework was built upon
		<span class="emphasis">jQuery</span>.
		I did some work on
		<span class="emphasis">server side UI</span>
		using Node.js'
		<span class="emphasis">Express</span>,
		and some of its template engines but found that approach
		inappropriate for Arigo's needs, which are much better covered
		by <span class="emphasis">client side UI</span>.
		For the evaluation of the next version I experimented with
		<span class="emphasis">Angular</span>,
		<span class="emphasis">Angular 2</span>, and
		<span class="emphasis">TypeScript</span>,
		but ultimately decided to use
		<span class="emphasis">web components</span>,
		powered by Google's
		<span class="emphasis">Polymer</span> and
		implemented in
		<span class="emphasis">object orientated JavaScript</span>,
		i.e.
		<span class="emphasis">EcmaScript 6/2015</span>.
		This was a huge relief after I had used my own object orientated
		JavaScript idiom at Echelon and jQuery UI's class system at
		Arigo - both are terribly clumsy compared to the built in
		elegance of EcmaScript 2015.
		</div>
		<div>
		As Arigo's CTO I managed the ongoing development, the people and
		the broad software architecture, worked with customers to
		understand their needs, discuss with our developers to figure
		out how to translate these needs into technology, estimate costs
		and keep one eye on the business side of our technology, the
		other on the future of our platform.
		</div>
		<div>
		My management style is decidedly non authoritarian. I work
		with grown up professionals and management is a service
		profession that facilitates developers getting their job done.
		My self perception is that of a mountain guide rather than a
		general, and I firmly believe this is the only way it can work
		with a distributed work force. People need to be aware
		of the consequences of their actions, but an iron fist a couple
		of hundred kilometers away would only weigh down him who raises
		it.
		</div>
		<div>
		Doubling as Arigo's single UI developer which took some 80% of
		my time, taught me to be very efficient in my communication. The
		specific combination of personalities in our company forced me
		to become a deescalation specialist or face the number one
		nemesis of start-ups: failure of communication. The former it
		was.

		Arigo is now a profitable endeavor with faithful customers.
		The really interesting stuff in IoT happens in scalable cloud
		deployments, not on the Pi - or rather the Pi-device-class may
		be the magic wand, but the magician enacts his tricks from high
		up in the cloud. So I moved to the cloud myself ...

		<h4>Lead developer at QiO technologies</h4>
		<div>
		... working remotely for QiO, an utterly distributed company,
		developing <span class="emphasis">enterprise
		grade scalable cloud IoT solutions</span> for big business
		customers. I hit the ground running, meeting the customer on my
		first day after induction training and started planning the
		project with my new distributed team.
		</div>
		<div>
		We employed
		<span class="emphasis">Docker</span>,
		<span class="emphasis">Kubernetes</span>, and
		<span class="emphasis">Mongo DB</span>,
		utilizing
		<span class="emphasis">GitLab</span>,
		<span class="emphasis">Artifactory</span> and
		<span class="emphasis">Jenkins</span> to
		power our
		<span class="emphasis">continuous integration
		pipeline</span>. Over a couple of months of
		<span class="emphasis">test driven</span>
		<span class="emphasis">Scrum</span>
		development we delivered a system that is now entering
		production with the next major version being planned by me and a
		new team as of now. While developing the UI mostly by myself,
		again using Google's Polymer
		<span class="emphasis">web-component</span>
		framework, I laid the foundations for a themable, localizable
		UI framework to be reused in productization of the project.

		<h4>Freelance IT consultant</h4>
		Having long considered - and on the side: tried - freelancing,
		I finally decided to go all in.
	</span>
</div>
<div>
	<label>2018</label>
	<span>
		<h4>Page-speed consultant at C&amp;A</h4>
		C&amp;A is one of the top German textile companies. My job was
		to make their online shop load faster. I performed a deep
		<span class="emphasis">page load analysis</span>
		including features and behavior of the
		<span class="emphasis">CDN</span>
		and documented my findings and proposed measures. Then I
		collaborated with the marketing,
		<span class="emphasis">tracking</span>-,
		<span class="emphasis">monitoring</span>-, and
		development-teams on how to implement the measures. I worked with
		<span class="emphasis">grafana</span> to
		measure the results of the improvements and implemented a custom
		<span class="emphasis">AMD</span>-like loader
		to prioritize and schedule the code excution. Finally I
		implemented a somewhat complex
		<span class="emphasis">Service Worker</span>
		to lower the loading delays.

		<h4>Free Software</h4>
		<div>
		When working on a private project I found myself (again) impressed by
		the lengths to which modern frameworks go in order to break the web
		platform - and ended up writing my own. I wanted to figure out the bare
		minimum required to write a bleeding edge modern web application. The
		result is
		<a href="https://github.com/schrotie/shadow-query">ShadowQuery</a>, a
		minimal, nano-sized library that helps avoiding the repetition of
		boilerplate when developing with
		<span class="emphasis">HTML5</span>,
		<span class="emphasis">CSS3</span>,
		<span class="emphasis">JavaScript</span>,
		<span class="emphasis">web components</span>,
		and nothing else. 
		</div>
		<div>
		When compared to apps built on common frameworks like Angular/React/Vue,
		apps developed with a strong focus on maximizing the use of
		<span class="emphasis">native technology</span>,
		turned out to lack nothing in terms of
		<span class="emphasis">code readability</span>,
		<span class="emphasis">expressiveness</span>,
		<span class="emphasis">consiseness</span>,
		<span class="emphasis">reuse</span>, and
		<span class="emphasis">maintainability</span>.
		The do, however, fare far better in terms of
		<span class="emphasis">performance</span> and
		<span class="emphasis">footprint</span>, as demonstrated in a dbmonster
		demo. This is true even for browsers that do not yet support the full
		web platform stack and thus have to use polyfills.
